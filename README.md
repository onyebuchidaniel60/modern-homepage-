# modern-homepage-
This is a one page website that basically aimss to show the sophistication of a professional homepage. 
It makes use of css display flex and grid to organize the site's layout. 
The site also makes use of a javaScript implemented image slider plus an overlay login form with html form validation.
I have not focused on the accessibility,responsiveness, and perfect scoring(maybe Chrome Lighthouse) of this site and 
will further work on this, site's still skeletal, more work to be done.
